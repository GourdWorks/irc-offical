       <h1 class="title">Rat Game</h1>

<center>
<p> 
A small indie game, created and manufactured by the combined efforts of the Central California Company and Rat Company. R.A.T is unlike any other creation of Rat Company, being the only one to be worked on, as Rat Company is mainly known for the creation of ideas that are never worked into actual products. It is a small top-down adventure roguelike game with a couple elements of other games that the second in command of Rat Company highly favored, but wanted them all mixed together into one. Thus, R.A.T came to be.
